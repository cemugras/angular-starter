##  angular-starter works

This repository contains the code of my works about learning Angular and some tries.

This course repository is updated to Angular v11


# Installation pre-requisites

IMPORTANT: Please use Node 14 (Long Term Support version).


# Installing the Angular CLI

With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

    npm install -g @angular/cli


# How To install this repository

This repository is made of several separate npm modules, that are installable separately. For example, to run the au-input module, we can do the following:

    cd angular-course
    npm install

Its also possible to install the modules as usual using npm:

    npm install

# To Run the Development Backend Server

In order to be able to provide realistic examples, we will need in our playground a small REST API backend server. We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

This is a small Node REST API server.

# To run the Development UI Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start

The application is visible at port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
